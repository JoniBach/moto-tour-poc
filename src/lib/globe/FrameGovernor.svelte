<!--
  Paces the globe's frame loop so it only works as hard as what's on screen needs: full speed
  while you're turning or zooming it and while one day gives way to the next; the ride playing at
  30 fps on phones and 60 elsewhere; and about 15 fps when nothing's happening, which is
  plenty for drifting clouds. Everything animates by elapsed time, so a lower rate changes
  smoothness, never speed. Replaces the renderer's animation loop (Threlte runs its scheduler
  from it) with one that skips frames.
